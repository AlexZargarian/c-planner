General Education Requirements
The General Education requirements consist of a minimum of 15 courses (45 semester credits) and have two components:
                        1. Foundation Courses (18 credits / 12 courses)

                        2. Breadth Requirements (a minimum of 27 credits / 9 courses), organized into coherent clusters of three courses in each of three broad sectors— Arts & Humanities, Social Sciences, Quantitative Sciences—chosen from electives outside the student’s major (in consultation with the adviser).

                           * Each cluster must include at least one lower-division course and at least one upper-division (integrative or advanced) course.

Cohesive Clusters are groups of three or more related courses, connected thematically and building depth or breadth in one or more disciplinary ways of thinking. Courses suitable for clusters are coded by theme:
                              * Themes 1, 2, 3 → Arts & Humanities (AH)

                              * Themes 4, 5, 6 → Social Sciences (SS)

                              * Themes 7, 8, 9 → Quantitative Sciences (QS)

Selecting three courses from the same theme satisfies one breadth cluster.
