Master of Public Affairs (MPA) Degree Requirements

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION


The Master of Public Affairs (MPA) is a year and a half degree program designed to give students the analytical, policy, administrative, and leadership skills needed to make an impact on Armenian society and beyond. Public organizations need leaders that are grounded in the perspective that policy challenges are fluid, interconnected, and global. Hence, MPA students are taught how to ask and answer political questions, how to design policy solutions to public problems, and how to administer those solutions with leadership and management skills for public, private, and nonprofit organizations. The program provides a substantive focus on development policy, strategy, and leadership – all essential to the construction of Armenian prosperity and stability.
