Master of Laws (LL.M.) Degree Requirements


The LL.M. degree requires completion of a minimum of 30 credits over 4 semesters (2 years), including the Master’s Paper and at least one credit in environmental studies in satisfaction of the university-wide environmental studies requirement.  Usually students take 1 mandatory, 3 or 2 elective courses each fall and spring earning between 9 and 6 credits per semester.


There are 4 required courses: LW 350 (Business Organizations), LW 334 (European Convention on Human Rights), LW 390 (Master’s Paper), and LW 365 (Administrative Law), typically one per semester. The remaining courses toward the degree are electives selected by students in consultation with their academic adviser.  Students are encouraged to be proactive in designing a program suited to their career and educational goals. Some may choose to concentrate in public or private law; others may prefer to pursue a more general course of study.  Students may also take courses outside of the LL.M. program with the permission of the Program Chair (usually limited to 1 course for the degree).


Unless otherwise noted, each mandatory course carries three credits, and electives carry one or two credits. The academic performance is evaluated through midterm and final exam, class assignments and participation in class discussions.


While the majority of students complete all requirements in two years, the maximum period for completion is three academic years, after which degree candidacy terminates automatically.  A course load of less than 9 or greater than 6 credits per semester requires prior approval from the Program Chair.
